# supplementalcalc
A repository for the supplemental lighting calculator (calc 2) for the LAMP Project.

With this calculator, users specify on how many days of year they want to be able to reach the target DLI (expressed as a percentage of 365 days). When set to 100%, this calculator is essentially the same as the ‘Unlimited lighting calculator’. But typically, there is no need or desire to reach the target DLI every single day. After entering what % of days you want to reach the target DLI, the calculator will determine the required lighting capacity, and provide a graphical summary of the lighting conditions you can expect in your greenhouse. This lighting system also estimates the demand charge, associated with the use of the lighting system. This calculator is particularly useful for the design of new lighting installations.
